# dvc and git : reffer pipelines as stages 
# stages contains what to do in sequence ( as same as pipeline  )
# in stages i add multiple stage to be followed in a sequence (in above i only have one stage but i can add more)
# after making stages we have to run a command :- dvc repro
# this command helps to run whole pipeline
# by this dvc keeping a track that due to change in parameters of py file if the data changes it tracks the data



# dvc.yaml and params.yaml
# In DVC, the dvc.yaml file is used to define stages
# , which collectively form a pipeline. Each stage in the 
# pipeline corresponds to a specific unit of work or a task 
# in  machine learning workflow. The params.yaml 
# file is often used to declare and manage parameters that can be dynamically 
# passed to your scripts or commands within the pipeline.
# Disclamer :- we should not declare the values in our py scripts rather feed the values to these scripts 
# dynamically from params.yaml file 
# after making changes to your params.yaml or dvc.yaml run command :- dvc repro
# this command rerun the whole pipeline where we have new values as changed
# after running this command ,our code and data changes
# data is tracked by dvc ( data is very important to track because for example in train test split making different splits of data with the corresponding accuracies must be tracked )
# if we dont track the data , data is overided as we perform multiple splits
# code is tracked by git


# using experimentation tracking we can perform multiple experiments on multiple paramaters and these 
# experiments are tracked by dvc ( by this we do experimentation tracking by performing version controls)




# here we have staged the info and params 
# using double click on workspace which is in dvc block we can modify and change the values of parameter and 
# track our experiments

# we have to make multiple files in a cleaner code sense


# after multiple experiments the experiment whose accuracy is very good i can mark that as a star
# after that double click on that experiment and create a new branch which is pushed on git
